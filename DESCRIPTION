Description: Modelling and inversion of ETAS model of seismicity using inlabru
    The Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model is designed to 
    model earthquakes that are triggered by previous events. In statistics, this is
    referred to as a Hawkes process.
    The code can be used to generate synthetic ETAS catalogues which can also
    include some seeded events to model specific sequences.
    We also implement a Bayesian inversion scheme using the Integrated Nested Laplace
    Approximation (INLA) using inlabru. 
    For the temporal model, given a training catalogue of times and magnitudes, the code 
    returns the joint posteriors for all the ETAS parameters.
    In the future roadmap, we will include tools to model the spatial distribution
    and spatio-temporal evolution of seismic sequences.
